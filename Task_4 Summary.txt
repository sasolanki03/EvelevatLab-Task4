---------------------------------------Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Linux (UFW)-------------------------------------------

Objective: Configure and test basic UFW firewall rules to allow or block traffic.
Tools Used: UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
Steps:
1. Check if UFW is installed:  sudo apt install ufw

2.Check firewall status:  sudo ufw status verbose

3.Enable UFW (if not already enabled):  sudo ufw enable

4. Block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet): sudo ufw deny 23

5. Test the block: Use `telnet localhost 23` or `nc -zv localhost 23` (should fail).

6. Allow SSH (port 22): sudo ufw allow 22

7. Remove the test rule (port 23): sudo ufw delete deny 23

8. Final firewall status with applied rules:  sudo ufw status numbered


Summary of Firewall Traffic Filtering:-  UFW filters network traffic based on rules like 'allow' or 'deny' for specific ports or IP addresses. It protects the system by only permitting necessary services (e.g., SSH on port 22) and blocking unwanted ones (like Telnet on port 23).

Outcome:
You now understand how to:
- Enable and manage UFW on Linux
- Add/remove basic firewall rules
- Improve Linux system security by filtering traffic
